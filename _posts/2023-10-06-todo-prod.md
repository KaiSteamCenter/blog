# Creating a Command-Line Todo List Application in Python

## **Introduction**

In this blog post, we will walk through the development of a simple command-line todo list application using Python. This application allows users to add and remove tasks from their todo list interactively. It serves as an excellent example of how to work with lists, user input, and loops in Python.

## **Getting Started**

Let's start by creating an empty list called `todos` to store our todo items. We will also define a function called `display_todos()` to display the current todo list.


```python
todos = []

def display_todos():
    print("\nYour current todos are:\n")
    if not todos:
        print("No todos yet!")
    else:
        for i, todo in enumerate(todos, start=1):
            print(f"{i}. {todo}")

```
The `display_todos()` function checks if the `todos` list is empty. If it is, it displays "No todos yet!" Otherwise, it lists each todo item with a unique number.

## **Interactive Loop**

To make the application interactive, we use an infinite while loop, which will keep running until the user decides to quit

```python
while True:
    display_todos()
    
    useraction = input("Would you like to add or remove a todo? (add/remove/stop").lower()
```
Inside the loop, we display the current todos using `display_todos()`. We then prompt the user to choose whether they want to add, remove, or stop a todo. The user's choice is stored in the `useraction` variable after converting it to lowercase.

## **Adding Todos**

If the user chooses to "add" a todo, we prompt them to enter a new todo and append it to the `todos` list.

```python
Copy code
if useraction == "add":
    new_todo = input("What is your new todo? ")
    todos.append(new_todo)
```

## **Removing Todos**

If the user chooses to "remove" a todo, we ask them to specify which todo to remove by its index. It'll handle potential errors, such as invalid input or an invalid index, and remove the specified todo if it's valid.


```python
    elif useraction == "remove" or useraction == "del" or useraction == "delete":
        try:
            index_to_remove = int(input("Which # todo would you like to remove: ")) - 1
            if 0 <= index_to_remove < len(todos):
                removed_todo = todos[index_to_remove] 
                del todos[index_to_remove]
                print(f"Removed: {removed_todo}")
            else:
                print("Invalid index. Please enter a valid index.")
                
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
            
```

## **Quitting the Application**

If the user decides to "quit," we print a farewell message and break out of the loop, ending the program.

```python
elif useraction == "quit":
    print("Goodbye!")
    break
```

## **Handling Invalid Input**

If the user enters any input other than "add," "remove," or "quit," we notify them of the invalid input.

```python
Copy code
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter 'add,' 'remove,' or 'quit'.")
```

# **Conclusion**

In this blog post, we have created a basic command-line todo list application in Python. This application allows users to manage their todos interactively, demonstrating fundamental concepts such as lists, user input, loops, and error handling. You can further enhance this application by adding features like saving todo lists to files or managing due dates for tasks. It serves as a useful starting point for building more complex Python applications.
