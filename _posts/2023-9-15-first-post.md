My summer was an incredible blend of learning and adventure. I decided to make the most of my break by working as an intern, diving headfirst into the world of web development. I was eager to expand my skill set, and so I dedicated my days to mastering JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I felt myself growing more confident and capable, paving the way for my future endeavors in the field.


But my summer wasn't all about coding ; I also was outside half of the time. One of my most exhilarating adventures was a 30-mile bike ride that took me from the streets of Brooklyn streets of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, and Scarsdale. Each pedal brought new sights,  and a profound sense of freedom that only a long bike journey can provide. This summer, for me, was an unforgettable mix of learning, celebration, and exploration, leaving me with cherished memories and a deep sense of fulfillment.
